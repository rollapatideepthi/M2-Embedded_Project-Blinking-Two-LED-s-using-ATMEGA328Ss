# Block Diagram



The structure will represent the pinout diagram of the project. It is shown below:

1.  In this section, we will learn How to blink two LEDs with AVR ATmega328 microcontroller. First, we will connect the 2 LED’s with PB2 and PB3 of  PORTB of the ATmega328 microcontroller. Then, we will make the 2 LED’s to blink with an interval of 1 second. It means, initially the 1st LED alone will glow and on the next second, it will turn off and the 2nd  one will glow. This process continues forever and in this way LEDs blinks continuously. 
2.  connect the cricuit as shown in the below diagram.
