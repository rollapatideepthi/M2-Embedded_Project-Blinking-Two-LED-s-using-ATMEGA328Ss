## REQUIREMENTS:

# Blinking Two LED's using ATMEGA328:

The blinking Two LED's circuit is like the electronics version of the “Hello World”-program. It’s a simple electronic circuit that gives you a visual cue if it works. It was the first circuit I ever built, and it felt GREAT!. The Project is developed in C language.

The concept of blinking two LED's is similar to the blinking of a single LED. As we know, we can use the resistance of any value, so let's take the resistors of 330 Ohms. The resistors reduce the amount of current reaching the LED, which saves the LED from being burnt.

We can also use other resistors depending on the circuit limit and requirements.

The structure of red and green LED is shown below:

The long terminal is called Anode (positive charged), and the short terminal is called Cathode (negative charged).

# components

The components used in the project are listed below:

1 x ATMEGA328 Board.
1 x Breadboard
4 x Jump wires
1 x Red LED
1 x Green LED We need to take 2 LEDs of any color. Here, we will use the red and green color LED.
2 x Resistor of 330 Ohm.

## SWOT ANALYSIS:

# STRENGTH:

Simple and easy to operate.
Increase efficiencies.
Saves time and reduces overheads.
Reduce operating cost.
Energy efficient – LED’s are now capable of outputting 135 lumens/watt.
Long Lifetime – 50,000 hours or more if properly engineered.
No warm-up period – LED’s light instantly – in nanoseconds.

# WEAKNESS:

Voltage sensitivity: LEDs must be supplied with the voltage above the threshold and a current below the rating. This can involve series resistors or current-regulated power supplies. High initial price: LEDs are currently more expensive, price per lumen, on an initial capital cost.
Area light source: LEDs do not approximate a “point source” of light, but rather a Lambertian distribution. So LEDs are difficult to use in applications requiring a spherical light field. LEDs are not capable of providing divergence below a few degrees. This is contrasted with lasers, which can produce beams with divergences of 0.2 degrees or less.

# OPPORTUNITIES:

Apart from those informations that are mentioned above in the objectives, you can also use your ideas how to take this project to next level by adding more informations like: Blinking all the LED's by using atmega328 etc..,

# THREATS:

inadequacy of infrastructure and hardware.

## 4W’s and 1’H

# Why:
The interface is user-friendly and simple to navigate.

# Where:
The blinking two LED's cricuit can be accessed from anywhere.

# Who:
It can be used by any purpose.

# When:
It can be used at anytime depending upon the person’s perferences.

# How:
By coonecting the cricuit you want to know.

# High Level Requirements

The function digitalWrite() is used to apply either HIGH or LOW voltage digitalWrite() takes two arguments, the pin number and the level of voltage, either HIGH or LOW, as we have discussed above. digitalWrite(led, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)

# Communication Protocols

Communication between electronic devices is like communication between humans. Both sides need to speak the same language. In electronics, these languages are called communication protocols.

 The basics of the three most common protocols: 
 1. Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) 
 2. Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) 
 3.  Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) driven communication.
